AirBnB Clone Project

Description of the Project

The AirBnB Clone project is a collaborative effort to create a simplified version of the AirBnB platform. The goal is to build a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with and manage property listings, user accounts, and bookings in a similar fashion to the AirBnB website.

How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the AirBnB Clone. Here are some key commands:

    create: Create a new instance of a class (e.g., create a new property listing).
    show: Display information about a specific instance (e.g., show details of a property listing).
    destroy: Delete a specific instance (e.g., delete a property listing).
    all: Display information about all instances or all instances of a specific class.
    update: Update the attributes of an instance.

For a complete list of commands and their usage, you can use the help command within the interpreter.
